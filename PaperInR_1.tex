\begin{abstract}

\section{Explaining Labels}\label{outline}

Sections may use a label\footnote{In fact, you can have a label wherever you think a future reference to that content might be needed.}. This label is needed for referencing. For example the next section has label \emph{datas}, so you can reference it by writing: As we see in section \ref{datas}.

\section{Data analysis}\label{datas}

Here you can explain how to get the data.

\subsection{Exploration}\label{eda}

Here, I start exploring the data. 

\subsection{Modeling}\label{model}

Here I can propose a regression model.
